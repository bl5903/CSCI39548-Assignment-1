  <h3>Turtles are reptiles with bony shells. The top of the shell is called a carapace
  and the bottom of the shell is called a plastron. The carapace and plastron consists of a
  bony structure that join each other along the side of the turtle's body, creating a rigid skeletal
  box.This shell is kept throughout the turtle's life. Since the shell is a part of the body, the turtle
  cannot exit the shell or shed the shell. There are approximately 356 different kinds of turtles that live on all
  continents except Antartica. One kind of turtle is a Tortoise. A Tortoise lives exclusively on land. Another kind of
  turtle is a Leatherback Sea Turtle. It lives near open ocean environment and comes ashore to lay eggs. They are largely
  carnivorous(eats meat) and consumes a wide variety of crustaceans.</h3>
