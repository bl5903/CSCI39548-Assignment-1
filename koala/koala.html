<p>Koalas are small mammals located in Australia. They may look like small versions of bears but they are not considered bears. Instead, they are considered marsupials. They live in the eastern sides of Australia and are seen a majority of the time hugging trees. A koala's diet is made up of mostly eucalyptus leaves which is not high in nutrients but they do manage to eat a lot of it.  Because their diet isn't high in nutrients, they sleep up to 18 hours a day which just leaves about 6 hours left in which they are awake and eating</p>
